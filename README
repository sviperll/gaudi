Gaudi
=====

Easy to use build system with minimum, almost zero config.

Capable: it's possible to download artifacts from maven central which is great for single bash script.

Project structure
-----------------

 * `build` - automatically generated directory where all generated files are put
 * `src` - directory for Java sources
 * `resources` - directory for resources that can be used by running application or by annotation processors during compilation
 * `compile-only-resources` - resources that should be present only during compilation, i. e. templates for generated code
 * `run-only-resources` - resources that should not be present during compilation,
   it's seldomly useful, for example when you develop annotation processor
